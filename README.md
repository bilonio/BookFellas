#BookFellas
BookFellas is a project for Software Engineering 1 course of ECE AUTH.  
We try to create an online application where everyone can share and upload books,  
create their own personal library and match interests with other passionate book lovers.  
When there are matching interests, users can exchange their books for free after communicating with each other.  
We hope that BookFellas will unite book worms from every corner and create a community where people share the same passion!
